Feature: Adding the product in the right risk bucket
  In order to make an informed decision as an individual investor I want to know the risk of the products I'm interested in

  Background:
    Given the rating associated to the countries are as follows :
      | countryCode | rating | shouldOverride |
      | FRA         | 1      | false          |
      | USA         | 2      | false          |
      | JAP         | 4      | false          |
      | IND         | 3      | true           |
      | GER         | 1      | true           |
      | ITA         | 5      | true           |

  Scenario: Depending on their characteristics, products will be added in a different bucket of the portfolio,
  based on the inherent risk that is computed. Below are overall rules :
  -> country : 1 = High, 2-3 = Medium, 4-5 = Low
  -> volatility : A-B = High, C-D = Medium, E = Low
  Whichever is highest risk between the 2 will be overall risk level for the product,
  unless country is flagged as overriding  in that case, country will take precedence

    Given I am interested in these products :

    When I add them in my portfolio
    Then the products are allocated in these risk buckets :
